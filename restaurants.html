                    Lula has been anchoring Logan Square's dining scene for over two decades now, 
                    and there's a reason it's still packed on weekends. The menu changes constantly 
                    based on what's coming in from local farms, which means you're never quite sure 
                    what you'll get, but you're almost always glad you got it.

                    The Monday night prix fixe is the move if you want the full experience without 
                    completely destroying your wallet. Last time I went, there was this roasted 
                    carrot dish with some kind of tahini situation that I'm still thinking about 
                    weeks later.

                    Order the farm egg if it's on the menu. I don't know what they do to it, 
                    but it's not like any egg you've made at home.

                    Diana Davila's place is doing something genuinely interesting with Mexican food 
                    that doesn't feel like it's trying too hard to be "elevated" or whatever. 
                    The flavors are bold and the presentations are beautiful without being fussy.

                    The queso fundido with rajas is mandatory. The carnitas are crispy in all the 
                    right places. And the mezcal list is deep enough to get you into trouble if 
                    you're not careful.

                    The pork belly tostada is a perfect bite. Crispy, fatty, acidic, all at once.

                    Look, sometimes you just want fried chicken and a frozen negroni on a patio, 
                    and Parson's delivers exactly that. The chicken is solid, not life-changing, 
                    but consistently good. The real draw is the vibe: picnic tables, slushie 
                    cocktails, and that feeling of summer even when it's barely warm enough to 
                    sit outside.

                <p>
                    The hush puppies are better than they need to be. The slaw is fine. 
                    The whole experience is greater than the sum of its parts.

                    A pie and ice cream shop that also does solid breakfast and lunch. 
                    The space is cozy in that way where you want to stay for hours with a book, 
                    which is exactly what I've done more times than I'd like to admit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The pies rotate seasonally and they take them seriously. The chess pie is 
                    a staple. The biscuits at brunch are the real deal, flaky and buttery and 
                    big enough to share (but you won't want to).
                </p>
                <div class="highlight">
                    Get a slice of whatever pie looks good and a scoop of ice cream. 
                    Don't overthink it.

                    The whiskey bar that also happens to serve really good food. The menu 
                    leans hearty and rich, which pairs well with the extensive bourbon selection. 
                    It's the kind of place where you end up staying longer than planned because 
                    the bartender keeps recommending things you haven't tried.

                    The bone marrow is indulgent in the best way. The burger is one of the 
                    better ones in the neighborhood. Brunch gets crowded but the wild boar 
                    sloppy joe is worth the wait.

                    Another pie spot in the neighborhood, with more of a Southern bent. 
                    The biscuit sandwiches are the main event here, stuffed with various 
                    combinations of eggs, cheese, and meat. The line on weekend mornings 
                    can be brutal, but it moves.

                    The pies are good, maybe not quite as refined as Spinning J, but 
                    the portions are generous and the prices are fair. The key lime is 
                    a standout.

                    A tiny French-ish spot on Humboldt Boulevard that feels like it was 
                    transported from some idealized version of Paris. The menu is small 
                    and changes often, but everything I've had has been carefully made 
                    and thoughtfully seasoned.

                    The rotisserie chicken is simple and perfect. The natural wine list 
                    is interesting without being pretentious. It's the kind of place where 
                    you trust the kitchen and just order whatever sounds good.
