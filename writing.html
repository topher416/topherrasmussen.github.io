                <div class="writing-content">
                    <p>Written during the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, this poem emerged during a period of profound uncertainty and change. Using the Sanskrit Gāyatrī form (three lines of eight syllables per stanza), the poem attempts to make meaning from chaos while honoring the Buddhist principles that inform my worldview.</p>
                    
                    <h3>COVID Sutra</h3>

                        The virus is not a poem.<br>

                        to call a crisis beautiful?<br><br>
                        
                        Start with what appears before you,<br>
                        Sheltering in place to practice<br>
                        Being still; sleeping and waking;<br><br>
                        
                        Watching the air go in and out;<br>
                        Lungs expanding and contracting;<br>
                        Life beginning and life ending<br><br>
                        
                        A transition of consciousness.<br>
                        To protect your respiration,<br>
                        And the global breathing function,<br><br>
                        
                        Sequester voluntarily.<br>
                        Notice what happens on its own.<br>
                        Spend time stopping. Try non-doing.<br><br>
                        
                        But who am I to give advice?<br>
                        And who are you to follow it?<br>
                        What is a person anyway?<br><br>
                        
                        Somewhere within your thinking mind<br>
                        Beneath and behind your ideas<br>
                        What your face looked like before birth<br><br>
                        
                        not after death; but in between<br>
                        Yes, this is happening right now<br>
                        With no beginning and no end.<br><br>

                    <p>This poem was written during a particularly difficult period when multiple crises converged—the pandemic, an earthquake in Salt Lake City, and the cancellation of artistic projects including a play I had been cast in. In this context, Sarah Ruhl (the playwright of that canceled production) read an early version of this poem, which led to a meaningful connection during an otherwise isolating time.</p>
                    
                    <p>The form of this poem is significant: in Vedic studies, the number 24 is considered harmonious because it is the product of all numbers between one and four (1 × 2 × 3 × 4 = 24). Each verse contains eight stanzas of three lines of eight syllables—24 syllables per stanza, 24 lines per verse.</p>
